## [1.3.0] 2026-02-25

### Added — Response to competition feedback

**`skill-card.md` (new — Critical deliverable):**
- Created required Skill Card with 7 sections: Tên Skill, Việc gì được automate, TRƯỚC (manual process table with time estimates), SAU (with-skill table + time savings), Tool/AI đã dùng, Limitation (6 items with workarounds), Roadmap mở rộng (Phase 2–5).
- Added Pre-Demo Checklist with 5-step checklist and all-in-one demo brief template.
- Quantified time savings: "~3 hours manual → ~15–25 minutes with skill".

**`ai-showcase/` (new folder — Critical deliverable):**
- `README.md`: folder overview and screenshot guide for live demo.
- `01-cook-spec-prompt.md`: prompt used to design initial spec; explains why constraints-first approach matters.
- `02-scoring-rubric-prompt.md`: prompt used to iterate scoring rubric from vague to bracket-specific; key insight on scoring consistency.
- `03-skill-md-prompt.md`: prompt used to rewrite skill.md; explains spec vs skill distinction.
- `04-edge-case-stress-test.md`: stress-test prompts that found 4 gaps (all-Tier-C, fabrication risk, estimated scores, smoke test).

**`SKILL.md` (renamed from `skill.md`):**
- Renamed to `SKILL.md` (uppercase) per Claude Skill convention.
- Added **Global Rules** section at the top (5 rules always enforced: no fabrication, ≤300 chars, cite source, no auto-send, flag uncertainty).
- Added **Demo/fast-start tip** in Step 2: if brief already contains answers to 3 clarifying questions, skip the gate and proceed directly.
- Added **Multi-language DMs** section in Step 5: Vietnamese DM instruction, `[VI]` tag, example format.
- Added **Output Quality Checklist** at end: 3 categories (DM quality, Scoring quality, Report completeness), 10 checkboxes.
- Added **Quick-Start Example** at end: all-in-one input format + expected output structure.

**`readme.md`:**
- Updated Project Structure tree to include all 6 files and `ai-showcase/` folder.
- Added distinction note: "SKILL.md is what Claude reads at runtime; skill-card.md is for stakeholders."

## [1.2.0] 2026-02-25

### Changed — `spec.md` + `skill.md` (scoring rubric push)

**spec.md — Section 3 (Business Value):**
- Added quantified value claim: "replaces 2–3 hours of manual KOL research + drafting per campaign".
- Added personalization lift data: "3–5× higher reply rates vs. generic templates".
- Added breakthrough statement: "full BD pipeline in one Claude session, zero external infrastructure".

**spec.md — Section 7.2 (Scoring Rubric):**
- Added Relevance score brackets (4 levels: deep expert → no mention) to mirror skill.md.
- Added Fit score brackets (3 levels: perfect match → mismatch) to mirror skill.md.
- Clarified Influence `estimated` case: assign bracket floor score (1), never fabricate a follower count.

**spec.md — Section 8 (Outreach Guardrails):**
- Added explicit rule: "Never fabricate follower counts or engagement metrics — only use data returned by web search."

**spec.md — Section 10 (Edge Cases):**
- Added "All leads score Tier C" edge case: output scorecard only, flag with actionable guidance.
- Added "Fabricated or unverifiable data" edge case: mark as Unknown, score conservatively, never invent data.

**skill.md — Step 3 (Discovery):**
- Added Manual Lead Merging section: how to handle user-provided must-include leads, [User-provided] label, scoring parity rule.

**skill.md — Step 5 (DM Guardrails):**
- Added explicit rule: "Never fabricate or estimate follower counts."

**skill.md — Edge Cases table:**
- Updated "No follower data" row to explicitly say "assign bracket floor score (1); never fabricate".
- Added "All leads score Tier C" row with actionable output instruction.

**skill.md — Frontmatter:**
- Removed unsupported `version` field (not in Claude Skill spec: supported fields are name, description, metadata, etc.).

## [1.1.1] 2026-02-25

### Rewritten — `skill.md`

Complete rewrite of the Claude Skill instruction file to align with `spec.md` v1.1.0.

**Removed (were out of scope per spec):**
- Outer ` ```markdown ``` ` wrapper — file is now clean Markdown.
- References to `database.py`, `web_scraper.py`, `main.py` — spec explicitly excludes persistent storage and custom code.
- Telegram Bot API / Telethon integration — the skill is a Claude Skill, not a bot.
- `/send_message` and `/sync_sheet` slash commands — out of scope.
- Google Sheets sync — out of scope.

**Added / Aligned:**
- 6-step linear flow matching spec: Parse Brief → Clarifying Questions → Discover → Score → Draft → Report.
- Scoring rubric updated to spec v1.1.0 brackets (Relevance, Influence with 6-level follower table, Fit).
- Role prominence +1 adjustment rule for Influence score.
- Hard ≤ 300-character limit on all DMs with trimming instruction.
- Edge cases table (too few leads, no follower data, conflicts, language mismatch, DM over limit).
- Explicit "What This Skill Does NOT Do" section to prevent scope creep.
- DM draft output format with character count annotation and `[GENERIC]` label pattern.

## [1.1.0] 2026-02-25

### Changed — `spec.md`

**Section 7.2 — Scoring Rubric: Influence score brackets added**
- Replaced vague "coarse brackets" description with a concrete 6-level follower bracket table (< 1K → > 500K), each mapped to a specific score range.
- Added role-prominence adjustment rule: confirmed prominent roles (VC partner, protocol co-founder, known CT figure) grant +1 to bracket score, max 10.
- Added `Influence: estimated` label when no follower data is available.

**Section 8 — DM Guardrails: hard character limit added**
- Added hard limit of **≤ 300 characters** per Telegram DM.
- Rationale: Telegram DMs beyond this length have significantly lower read rates; the skill must trim aggressively.
- Updated Section 11 success criteria to reflect the 300-char requirement.

**Section 11.1 — Pre-Demo web_search Discovery Validation (new)**
- Added a Day 2 smoke-test gate for `web_search` discovery across 3 different niches.
- Each niche must return ≥ 5 scoreable profiles to pass.
- Failure condition triggers immediate query construction review before demo day.

**Section 12 — Full Sample Output (new)**
- Added a complete end-to-end output example using a PredictDAO beta outreach campaign.
- Includes: Executive Summary, Lead Scorecard (5 leads across all tiers), and Telegram DM Drafts (Tier A × 2, Tier B × 2 including one GENERIC-flagged draft).
- All DMs in the sample are within the 300-char limit with character counts noted.
